# Hangman-with-C-Raylib
A beginner-friendly Hangman game developed in C with Raylib, including a computer mode with multiple levels and a friend mode.

This is my first Hangman game developed using the Raylib library and written in the C programming language.

## 🎮 Game Modes

- **Play Against the Computer**  
  A single-player mode with 4 levels.  
  Each level increases the number of letters in the word, making the game progressively harder.

- **Play with a Friend**  
  A local multiplayer mode where one player enters the word and the other tries to guess it.

> Currently, all words and in-game texts are in Turkish.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
